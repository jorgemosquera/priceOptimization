# Using Data Analytics for Price Optimization.
When selling a used car, it’s difficult to know where to start. With so many options like trade ins, internet dealers or private, it is hard to decide, especially when the objective is to get as much money as possible for a well-maintained vehicle.

But exactly how much money can I get for my used car? According to Carfax.ca, the key when selling a used car, is to set a competitive and accurate asking price in order to sell it as quickly as possible and for the best amount. If the price is too high, there will be no interest but if the price is too low, I may not get as much as it’s worth.

In order to set a competitive and accurate asking price, the key as always, is to have as much information as possible to make a well-informed decision. So, the goals of this project is given a car with its characteristics, define what will be the optimal asking price in order to sell it as quickly as possible and for the best amount.

## Understanding the Problem
First, it was important to understand the factors that could impact the value of a used car. According to the experts, the value of a used car depends basically in the model year , driven kilometers and overall condition. Accident history is also important. Other factors include colour, number of previous owners, service history and after-market features.  

Second, I needed to find sources of data from the used car market. But exactly how much data can I find?
The first place to look for used car data is the local car magazine. In the case of Colombia, the most popular magazine is Revista Motor that weekly prints out a reference table based on the following assumptions:

  - Average asking price of the Bogota vehicles.
  - 20Km per year
  - The year range goes from 08 to 19.

The data is available in a pdf file that I will need to scrape according to the car model and year.

The second place to look for used car data is at the most popular internet dealer websites. In there I was able to find different offers according to the model, year and driven kilometers. The offers also specified detailed information like number of previous owners, colour, and after-market features.

## Data Gathering
Using Python, I created a web scraper in order to get all the data related to my car. In this project, I used a popular site.

Data analytics is a powerful tool to make well-informed decisions. Using the process of setting a problem, understanding the background, gather, clean and analyze data, it is easy to draw well-informed decisions.
